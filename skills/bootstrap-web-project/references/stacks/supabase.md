# Supabase and PostgreSQL profile

Use this profile whenever the project uses Supabase or exposes PostgreSQL data
through the Supabase Data API. It is an overlay: apply it on top of a Fastify,
Nest or React profile, or on the root of a full-stack monorepo. The decisions
are recorded in ADR 0007 of the foundation repository.

## Profile asset

The overlay lives in `assets/stacks/supabase/`:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `.env.example` | Hosted project URL and publishable/secret key names appended to the base file |
| `supabase/migrations/*.sql` | Reference migration: RLS, revoked defaults, column grants, owner policies, `updated_at` trigger |

## Files to apply

The skill script performs the file steps below; they are the specification it
implements.

1. Apply the base profile first.
2. Copy `assets/stacks/supabase/`: append `.env.example` and copy the reference
   migration under `supabase/migrations/`.
3. Add `@supabase/supabase-js` from the `supabase` profile in `versions.json`
   as an exact runtime dependency. Do not install the Supabase CLI or require a
   container runtime as part of this profile.
4. Replace the reference `profiles` migration with the real initial schema,
   keeping its RLS, grant and policy structure as the model.
5. Select the hosted or local migration and type-generation workflow that fits
   the project. Keep generated database types committed, but do not add its
   provider tooling to the baseline unless the project actually needs it.

## Client integration

- Browsers receive only the publishable key and reach data through RLS.
- Backends create one client per request with the user's access token so
  policies apply, and keep a separate secret-key client for administrative
  tasks that are authorized in application code.

```ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

import type { Database } from './database.types.ts'

export function createUserClient(
  url: string,
  publishableKey: string,
  accessToken: string,
) {
  return createClient<Database>(url, publishableKey, {
    auth: { autoRefreshToken: false, persistSession: false },
    global: { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}` } },
  })
}
```

## `SUPA-RLS-001` — Row Level Security with explicit grants on every table

- **Level:** MUST
- **Applies to:** Supabase projects
- **Risk levels:** R1, R2, R3
- **Requirement:** Enable RLS on every table in an exposed schema, revoke the
  default grants from `anon` and `authenticated`, grant only the operations and
  columns the policies allow, and write policies with `(select auth.uid())`.
  Views, functions and storage policies are part of the same authorization
  surface. Do not use user-editable metadata as authorization data.
- **Rationale:** Grants define what is possible and policies define which rows;
  either one alone leaves the Data API open.
- **Verification:** The foundation's generated-project test rejects migrations
  that create a table without RLS, revocation and policies. Project review
  checks that each real policy matches its authorization matrix.
- **Sources:** [Supabase Row Level Security](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security), [Supabase column-level privileges](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/column-level-security), `SEC-AUTHZ-001`.
- **Exceptions:** A deliberately public table documents its policy and still
  enables RLS with an explicit `select` policy.

## `SUPA-KEYS-001` — publishable in clients, secret on servers

- **Level:** MUST
- **Applies to:** Supabase projects
- **Risk levels:** R1, R2, R3
- **Requirement:** Use the publishable key in browsers and mobile clients and
  the secret key only in server-side code and CI. Never place the secret key in
  `VITE_` variables, client bundles, logs or fixtures. Map the legacy `anon`
  and `service_role` names to these roles only where a tool still requires
  them.
- **Rationale:** The secret key bypasses RLS; its exposure defeats every
  database policy.
- **Verification:** Search tracked files and built bundles for `sb_secret_` and
  service-role material; review `.env.example` names.
- **Sources:** [Supabase API keys](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/api-keys), `SEC-SECRETS-001`, `REACT-ENV-001`.
- **Exceptions:** None.

## `SUPA-MIGRATION-001` — reproducible schema and synchronized types

- **Level:** MUST
- **Applies to:** Supabase projects
- **Risk levels:** R1, R2, R3
- **Requirement:** Change schema, grants, policies, functions and storage
  configuration only through versioned migrations. Preserve invariants with
  constraints, index foreign keys and policy columns when query plans require
  it and regenerate `database.types.ts` after each migration. If the project
  adds seed data, keep it synthetic and free of production records.
- **Rationale:** Migrations make environments reproducible and reviewable;
  drifting types hide contract changes from the type checker.
- **Verification:** The selected migration workflow applies the history to a
  clean non-production database; committed generated types pass typecheck and
  are reviewed with the schema change.
- **Sources:** [Supabase migrations](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/deployment/database-migrations), [Supabase generating types](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/rest/generating-types), `DEP-LOCK-001`.
- **Exceptions:** Emergency production fixes are captured as a migration
  immediately afterwards.

## `SUPA-TEST-001` — live authorization tests are opt-in

- **Level:** MAY
- **Applies to:** Supabase projects
- **Risk levels:** R1, R2, R3
- **Requirement:** The baseline does not install database test tooling, require
  Docker or ship pgTAP suites. A project may add live authorization tests in an
  isolated environment when its threat model and delivery workflow justify
  them; those tests should exercise anonymous, owning and non-owning identities
  across the operations exposed by the Data API.
- **Rationale:** Live policy tests provide stronger assurance, but their local
  stack and CI runner cost should be an explicit project decision rather than
  a bootstrap prerequisite.
- **Verification:** The generated manifest contains no Supabase CLI or `db:*`
  scripts. When a project opts in, review its test matrix and isolation model.
- **Sources:** [Supabase testing overview](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/testing/overview), `SEC-TEST-001`, `SEC-R2-AUTHZ-001`.
- **Exceptions:** None; this capability is optional.

## `SUPA-FUNCTION-001` — invoker rights by default

- **Level:** MUST
- **Applies to:** Supabase projects with database functions
- **Risk levels:** R1, R2, R3
- **Requirement:** Create functions as `security invoker` with an empty
  `search_path`. A `security definer` function needs a documented reason, an
  explicit `search_path`, input validation and revoked `execute` from roles
  that must not call it.
- **Rationale:** Definer functions run with the owner's privileges and bypass
  RLS, turning any caller into a privileged actor.
- **Verification:** The generated-project test rejects `security definer` in
  template migrations; review each definer function against the exception
  record.
- **Sources:** [Supabase database functions](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/functions), [PostgreSQL CREATE FUNCTION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createfunction.html), `SEC-AUTHZ-001`.
- **Exceptions:** As stated in the requirement, with owner and review date.
