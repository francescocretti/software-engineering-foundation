# Source register

This register records provenance. Inclusion does not mean that a source is
adopted wholesale.

## Internal repositories

| Source | Primary contribution | Treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bailu-admin` | React organization and project structure | Extract proven patterns; do not modify source |
| `bailu-api` | Nest and Supabase backend patterns | Extract proven patterns; do not modify source |
| `BlackBytes/eslint-config` | Strict ESLint rule candidates | README and implementation are source of truth; curate rather than depend on it |
| `fta-admin` | Full-stack monorepo structure and developer tooling | Extract client/server/shared patterns; do not modify source |
| `agami-cloud` | Complex tests and CI/CD experience | Extract lessons; never reproduce secret-printing behavior |

Exact standard and tool versions are recorded when their requirements are
implemented, so future updates can be reviewed deliberately. Security profiles
remain pinned to ASVS 5.0.0 until a reviewed foundation change updates the
requirement mappings and project migration guidance.
